iTTS Reader
===========

A very basic TTS app, based on the pyttsx Python library.

## Installation

Just install the `pyttsx` module, for example using pip:

```shell
pip install pyttsx
```

A working TTS engine is also needed, for example, installed voices on Windows for the default SAPI, and an installed espeak with some voice module on linux.

## Using the app

Start the app with python:

```shell
python iTTSReader.py
```

Just copy or type any text into the window, select from the list of the installed voices, and press the _Speak_ button. Pressing Control+Enter also read the text.
